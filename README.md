# Snake-Game

Java GUI game where the user controls a snake to eat apples. As more apples are eaten, the snake's length and speed increases. If the snake crashes into itself the game is over. The objective is to have the snake grow as large as possible before it crashes, or "eats", itself. 

The game is written in Java and Java's Swing GUI API. The game is started in the command line/terminal by running RunSnakeGame.java, which opens up the game window.
